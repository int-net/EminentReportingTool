# Introduction


This report contains the result of the EMINENT Interoperability Maturty Assessment that has been performed by members of the cim-expert-group community. 

The report is built up in the following way:
- Respondent analysis: here the report discusses who has respondet to the questionnaire in terms of: 
    - The area(s) of expertise of the respondents
    - The area(s) of operation of the organizations the respondents represent.
- Maturity Assessment: here the report discusses the maturity scores that follow from the responses that were received. This is done in 4 steps
    - First, the overal maturity scores for the 10 capabilities are discussed
    - Then, for each of the 3 high level capabilities, the report will share the results down to the dimension level.

# Respondent Analysis


This section will give insights into who has responded to the questionnaire. This will be done by looking at the area of expertise of the respondents, as well as the area of operation of the organizations they represent. Both the area of expertise and area of operation are expressed in terms of the the SGAM model
## Area of expertise of the respondents


Respondents were asked to indicate their area of expertise in terms of the SGAM model. The results of the responses has been shown in the diagram below.

# Maturity Assessment


Respondents were asked to fill out a questionnaire in which each of the questions targeted a different dimension of each of the 10 interoperability capabilities. Respondents were asked to select the characteristic that best fit how they experienced that dimension. The results were aggregated to dimension and capability level. This section contains the aggregated result of that excersize.
